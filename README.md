## Extra Fields

Purity supports the following fields in your `config.toml`:

## Contributions

I am open to contributions, but Purity is built specifically for my personal blog, so additional features which I do not personally want or need will not be merged. I encourage you to open an issue if you wish to make any substantial changes.
